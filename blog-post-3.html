                    <p class="blog-post__excerpt">From the hiring manager's perspective: warning signs that indicate a role might derail your career.</p>
                </header>
                <div class="blog-post__content">
                    <p>After conducting thousands of interviews and making hundreds of hires, I've learned that the interview process reveals just as much about the company as it does about the candidate. Sometimes, the smartest career move is turning down an offer.</p>
                    <p>Here are the red flags I wish someone had taught me to recognize earlier in my career—the warning signs that a role could damage your professional trajectory rather than advance it.</p>
                    <h2>Red Flag #1: Unclear Role Definition</h2>
                    <p>If your interviewers can't clearly articulate what success looks like in this role or seem to have conflicting ideas about your responsibilities, that's a serious warning sign.</p>
                    <p>At Fortune 500 companies, role clarity matters. I've seen talented professionals accept poorly defined positions only to find themselves pulled in multiple directions, unable to demonstrate clear impact, and ultimately blamed for failing to meet expectations that were never properly established.</p>
                    <p>Ask directly: "What does success look like in the first six months?" If you get vague answers or responses that contradict what other interviewers said, proceed with extreme caution.</p>
                    <h2>Red Flag #2: High Team Turnover Without Explanation</h2>
                    <p>During your interview, ask how long team members have been in their roles. If you notice a pattern of short tenures—especially if multiple people left within the past year—dig deeper.</p>
                    <p>Healthy teams have a mix of tenure. If everyone has been there less than 18 months, or if the hiring manager is new and rebuilding the entire team, you need to understand why. Was the previous manager pushed out? Did the team fail to deliver? Is there a toxic executive above them?</p>
                    <p>A good response acknowledges the turnover and explains what changed. A red flag response deflects, minimizes, or blames "people who couldn't handle the pace."</p>
                    <h2>Red Flag #3: Disorganized Interview Process</h2>
                    <p>Pay attention to how the company treats you during the interview process. Last-minute reschedules, interviewers who haven't reviewed your resume, or multiple rounds with no clear decision timeline—these aren't just annoying, they're predictive.</p>
                    <p>If a company can't organize a structured interview process, they likely struggle with basic operational execution. You'll experience the same dysfunction as an employee.</p>
                    <h2>Red Flag #4: Pressure to Accept Quickly</h2>
                    <p>Legitimate offers come with reasonable decision timelines—typically one to two weeks. If a hiring manager pressures you to accept within 24-48 hours "or the offer goes away," that's manipulation, not urgency.</p>
                    <p>At Microsoft, we gave candidates time to make informed decisions. We wanted people who chose us deliberately, not people who felt cornered into accepting.</p>
                    <p>Companies that rush you are either poorly organized, desperate to fill a seat because of high turnover, or trying to prevent you from comparing offers. None of these scenarios work in your favor.</p>
                    <h2>Red Flag #5: Evasive Answers About Why the Role Is Open</h2>
                    <p>Always ask: "Why is this position open?" The answer reveals a lot. Good answers include growth, reorganization, or retirement. Red flag answers are vague ("we're expanding the team") or defensive.</p>
                    <p>If the role is a backfill and they won't tell you where that person went or why they left, you need that information. If they fired the previous person, what specifically went wrong? If the person quit, where did they go and why?</p>
                    <h2>Trust Your Instincts, Then Verify</h2>
                    <p>If something feels off during the interview process, don't ignore that instinct. But also do your homework: reach out to current or former employees on LinkedIn, research the company's reviews on Glassdoor with a critical eye, and ask pointed questions.</p>
                    <p>Remember: accepting the wrong role can set your career back by years. It's far better to keep searching than to accept a position that will leave you miserable, stressed, and looking for an exit six months later.</p>
