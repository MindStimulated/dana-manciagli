  complete the git setup and guide you through the deployment process.

⏺ Perfect! I've successfully committed all the files to git. Since GitHub CLI isn't
  installed, I'll guide you through creating the repository manually and provide you with
  the exact commands to run.

  Here's what to do next:

  Step 1: Create the GitHub Repository

  1. Go to https://github.com/new
  2. Fill in the repository details:
    - Repository name: dana-manciagli (or whatever you prefer)
    - Description: "Professional legacy website for Dana Manciagli - Career coach and
  Fortune 500 expert"
    - Visibility: Choose Public or Private
    - DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
  3. Click "Create repository"

  Step 2: Push Your Code

  After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Run
  these commands in your terminal:

  cd /Users/shoetieai/Documents/dana-manciagli
  git branch -M main
  git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dana-manciagli.git
  git push -u origin main

  Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.

  Step 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages

  Once your code is pushed:

  1. Go to your repository on GitHub
  2. Click Settings tab
  3. Scroll to Pages section in the left sidebar
  4. Under "Source", select:
    - Branch: main
    - Folder: / (root)
  5. Click Save
  6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
  7. Your site will be live at: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/dana-manciagli/

  Would you like me to help with anything else, or would you prefer me to wait while you 
  create the repository and then help with the next steps?

> please check to make sure the CLI is not already installed. It should be installed to my 
/documents folder but here's the direct link, I just created a new repository: 
https://github.com/MindStimulated/dana-manciagli 

⏺ Let me check for the GitHub CLI installation and then push your code to the repository
  you just created.

⏺ Bash(which gh)
  ⎿  Error: gh not found

⏺ Bash(find ~/Documents -name "gh" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(ls -la /usr/local/bin/gh)
  ⎿  Error: ls: /usr/local/bin/gh: No such file or directory

⏺ GitHub CLI isn't installed, but that's fine! Since you've already created the repository,
   let me push the code directly using git.

⏺ Bash(git branch -M main)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git remote add origin https://github.com/MindStimulated/dana-manciagli.git)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git push -u origin main)
  ⎿  branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.           
     To https://github.com/MindStimulated/dana-manciagli.git
      * [new branch]      main -> main

⏺ Perfect! Your code has been successfully pushed to GitHub. Now let's enable GitHub Pages
  deployment.

  To deploy the website:

  1. Go to: https://github.com/MindStimulated/dana-manciagli/settings/pages
  2. Under "Build and deployment" → "Source", select:
    - Branch: main
    - Folder: / (root)
  3. Click Save

  Your website will be live in 1-2 minutes at:
  https://mindstimulated.github.io/dana-manciagli/

  Would you like me to wait while you enable GitHub Pages, or is there anything else you'd
  like me to help with?
