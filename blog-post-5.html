<p>It’s hard; I get it. You are afraid of being too niched and, therefore, want to have a broad description. Or you don’t want to be a jack-of-all-trades, so you define your goal very narrowly.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6373" src="https://www.danamanciagli.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/What-When-You-Grow-Up_2_052920-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://www.danamanciagli.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/What-When-You-Grow-Up_2_052920-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.danamanciagli.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/What-When-You-Grow-Up_2_052920-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.danamanciagli.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/What-When-You-Grow-Up_2_052920.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Over 60% of those looking answer, “I’m not really sure,” when asked about what they want in their next job. Or they disguise their lack of clarity as, “Well, I’m thinking about a number of things,” or “There are so many things I’m qualified to do.” Do you ever find yourself saying, “I know what I want, but it’s not out there,” or “I will know it when I see it.” Believe me, I’ve heard them all!</p>
<p>I am more concerned about those job-seekers who describe their next job in <strong>squishy</strong> terms that mean absolutely nothing. Do any of these vague goals sound familiar?</p>
<ul>
<li>“I’m looking for an exciting position that solves problems in a company with a good culture.”</li>
<li>“I want to leverage my skills in project management, communications, and analysis by working in a high-growth company.”</li>
<li>“I want to be the one who takes the new business ideas and runs with them.”</li>
<li>“I want to be in a senior position within the healthcare industry.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Below, I provide my favorite FREE resources for being clear with your job search goal. Our U.S. Military transitioning service members, Veterans, and their spouses, can be unfamiliar with how companies are organized in the “civilian” world, and these resources will be extra helpful for them.</p>

It contains hundreds of standardized and occupation-specific descriptors on almost 1,000 occupations covering the entire U.S. economy. The database, which is available to the public at no cost, is updated continually with input from a range of workers in each occupation. Content includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anatomy of an occupation</li>
<li>“My Next Move” to type in keywords or just browse</li>
<li>Career Exploration Tools with assessments</li>

<p>Here is a framework for those of you who know what you want but cannot articulate it clearly. Complete this sentence, and you’ll be able to announce your goal with confidence to your network, your friends, and at job or career fairs.</p>
<p><em>“I am looking for a &lt;function/role&gt; position in the &lt;industry&gt; in &lt;city, state&gt;. “</em></p>
<ul>
<li>That’s it! Stop talking and engage with the person with whom you are sharing.</li>
<li>Have two to three company targets to share, if asked.</li>
<li>Ideally, have a single target but max out at two, if needed!</li>
</ul>
<p>Good examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am looking for a sales position in Chicago with a large corporation in the medical or manufacturing industry.</li>
<li>I have been doing a lot of research, and I am focused on two types of career opportunities. One is a logistics manager in a distribution center here in Orange County. However, I am also looking at opportunities in teaching logistics at local educational centers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, you are competing against others who ARE confident in their goal and have focused their resume and interview practice to reach their goal. Do your research, then have conviction in your choice.</p>
