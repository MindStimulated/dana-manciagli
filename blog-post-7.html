                    <p class="blog-post__excerpt">How to leverage your experience when changing industries—and why your age is an advantage, not a liability.</p>
                </header>
                <div class="blog-post__content">
                    <p>I've hired plenty of career changers in their 40s, 50s, and beyond at Fortune 500 companies. Some transitions were remarkably successful. Others struggled and ultimately failed. The difference wasn't talent or motivation—it was strategy.</p>
                    <p>If you're considering an industry pivot mid-career, here's what actually works based on what I've observed from both sides of the hiring table.</p>
                    <h2>Your Experience Is Transferable (If You Frame It Right)</h2>
                    <p>The biggest mistake career changers make is apologizing for their background. "I know I don't have direct experience in this industry, but..."</p>
                    <p>Stop. Your decades of professional experience are valuable—you just need to translate them into the language of your target industry.</p>
                    <p>When I hired a retail executive into a tech role at Microsoft, she didn't focus on her lack of tech experience. She highlighted her expertise in customer experience, operations at scale, and team leadership—all directly applicable to our needs.</p>
                    <p>Identify the transferable skills: leadership, strategic thinking, financial management, operational excellence, change management. These are universal and often more valuable than industry-specific knowledge, which can be learned.</p>
                    <h2>Do Your Homework on Industry Differences</h2>
                    <p>Every industry has its own culture, pace, and unwritten rules. Technology companies operate differently than manufacturing companies. Nonprofits have different priorities than Fortune 500 corporations.</p>
                    <p>Before you interview, research:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What are the key performance indicators in this industry?</li>
                        <li>What challenges is this sector currently facing?</li>
                        <li>How do decisions get made differently than in your current industry?</li>
                        <li>What's the typical career progression?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Demonstrate this knowledge in your interviews. It shows you're serious about the transition and have realistic expectations.</p>
                    <h2>Network Strategically, Not Desperately</h2>
                    <p>You can't cold-apply your way into a new industry at this career stage. You need advocates—people who can vouch for your capabilities despite your unconventional background.</p>
                    <p>Target your networking around people who have made similar transitions or who value diverse perspectives. Attend industry events, join relevant professional associations, and seek informational interviews with people in roles you're targeting.</p>
                    <p>Your goal isn't to ask for a job. It's to learn about the industry, understand the challenges, and demonstrate your genuine interest and relevant capabilities.</p>
                    <h2>Consider a Lateral or Step-Back Move</h2>
                    <p>This is hard to accept, but it's realistic: you may need to take a step back in title or compensation to make your initial transition. Not always—but be prepared for that possibility.</p>
                    <p>A VP in retail might need to accept a Director role in tech initially. That's not failure—it's a strategic investment in your new career path. Once you prove yourself and build industry credibility, advancement can be rapid.</p>
                    <p>The professionals I've seen succeed with this approach view it as a short-term trade-off for long-term opportunity. Those who insist on maintaining their current level often struggle to get offers.</p>
                    <h2>Address the Elephant in the Interview</h2>
                    <p>Hiring managers are wondering: "Why now? Why this industry? Will you actually commit, or will you leave when something in your original field comes along?"</p>
                    <p>Address this directly with a clear, credible narrative. Not: "I'm just looking for something different." Instead: "I've spent 20 years building expertise in customer experience, and I've watched your industry transform how it approaches customer relationships. I want to apply my background to these challenges specifically because..."</p>
                    <p>Your story needs to demonstrate that this isn't a desperate escape from a bad situation, but a thoughtful decision to apply your expertise in a new context where you can make a significant impact.</p>
                    <h2>Your Age Is Actually an Advantage</h2>
                    <p>Yes, there's age bias in hiring. But there's also massive value in maturity, judgment, and proven track record that only comes with experience.</p>
                    <p>The career changers I've hired successfully brought something we couldn't get from traditional candidates: broader perspective, refined leadership skills, and the confidence that comes from having navigated challenges across different contexts.</p>
                    <p>Don't downplay your experience. Position it as your competitive advantage. You're not an inexperienced candidate who needs to learn everything. You're an experienced professional bringing fresh perspective and proven capabilities to new challenges.</p>
                    <p>The key is demonstrating that you respect what you need to learn about the new industry while confidently articulating the unique value you bring from your background.</p>
