                </header>
                <div class="blog-post__content">
                    <p>Executive presence used to be about how you walked into a room. Now it's about how you show up on a screen—and most professionals are getting it completely wrong.</p>
                    <p>During my years leading teams at Microsoft, I watched the shift to virtual work. The executives who maintained their influence mastered specific techniques for commanding presence through video. Those who didn't saw their impact diminish, regardless of their expertise.</p>
                    <p>Here's what actually works when you're building executive presence virtually.</p>
                    <h2>Your Video Setup Is Your Office</h2>
                    <p>In person, your office conveys status and professionalism. On video, your background and setup do that work. Yet I constantly see senior professionals on calls with terrible lighting, distracting backgrounds, or poor camera angles.</p>
                    <p>Get this right: invest in a good external webcam positioned at eye level. Ring lights are inexpensive and eliminate the unflattering shadows from overhead lighting. Your background should be neutral and professional—either a real office setting or a subtle virtual background.</p>
                    <p>The camera should be at eye level, not looking up at you from your laptop. This creates the same eye contact dynamic as an in-person conversation and conveys confidence rather than submission.</p>
                    <p>These technical details matter. Executives notice when someone consistently appears polished on video versus looking unprepared or amateurish.</p>
                    <h2>Speak Less, Impact More</h2>
                    <p>Virtual meetings amplify a truth about leadership: executive presence isn't about talking the most. It's about making your contributions count when you do speak.</p>
                    <p>The professionals with real presence in virtual settings wait for strategic moments. They listen actively, synthesize what others have said, and then contribute insights that shift the conversation or clarify decisions.</p>
                    <p>When you speak, be concise. Virtual meetings punish rambling more harshly than in-person meetings. State your point clearly, support it with one or two key facts, and stop talking. This is harder than it sounds, but it dramatically increases your impact.</p>
                    <h2>Control Your Visible Reactions</h2>
                    <p>In a conference room, you can have private sidebar conversations or discrete reactions. On video, gallery view means everyone sees every eye roll, every distracted glance at your phone, every moment you're not paying attention.</p>
                    <p>Executives with strong virtual presence maintain engaged body language even when they're not speaking. They nod at key points, maintain focus on speakers, and control their facial expressions.</p>
                    <p>This doesn't mean fake enthusiasm for everything. It means being intentional about what your reactions communicate. If you disagree with something, save your concerns for a thoughtful verbal contribution rather than letting your expression telegraph your opinion.</p>
                    <h2>Master the Strategic Interruption</h2>
                    <p>Interrupting is generally rude—except when it's strategic and necessary. In virtual meetings, you sometimes need to interrupt to be heard, especially in large meetings where people talk over each other.</p>
                    <p>The key is how you do it. Don't just start talking louder. Use the person's name: "John, can I build on that point?" or "Sarah, before we move on, I think we need to address..."</p>
                    <p>This technique politely signals you have something important to contribute while giving the current speaker a graceful way to yield the floor. It demonstrates confidence without being aggressive.</p>
                    <h2>Use Chat Strategically, Not Constantly</h2>
                    <p>The chat function is a tool for amplifying your presence, not a running commentary track. I see professionals dilute their impact by constantly typing reactions or side comments in chat.</p>
                    <p>Use chat for: sharing relevant links or data, asking clarifying questions that don't need to interrupt the flow, or highlighting key points that deserve emphasis. Don't use it for: jokes, play-by-play reactions, or trying to have side conversations during important discussions.</p>
                    <p>When you do use chat, keep it professional and valuable. Senior executives notice who uses chat to add value versus who uses it to distract or show off.</p>
                    <h2>Own the Follow-Up</h2>
                    <p>Virtual meetings often end without clear ownership of next steps. This is your opportunity to demonstrate leadership.</p>
                    <p>Before the meeting ends, summarize key decisions and action items. If no one else is doing this, volunteer. "Let me capture the key outcomes from today..." This positions you as organized, action-oriented, and someone who drives results.</p>
                    <p>Then send a brief follow-up email within an hour summarizing decisions, next steps, and owners. This isn't just good practice—it's a power move that keeps you visible and positions you as a leader who ensures accountability.</p>
                    <h2>The Camera-Off Decision</h2>
                    <p>There's debate about when it's acceptable to turn your camera off. Here's my take: in small meetings, leadership meetings, or when you're expected to actively contribute, camera off signals disengagement.</p>
                    <p>In large all-hands meetings or when you're truly just listening, camera off is fine. But if you're trying to build executive presence, err on the side of camera on in any meeting where you might contribute or where senior leaders are present.</p>
                    <p>Your presence matters. Being visible signals engagement and availability, even when you're not actively speaking.</p>
                    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                    <p>Executive presence in virtual settings isn't about being the loudest voice or appearing in the most meetings. It's about being consistently professional in your setup, strategic in your contributions, and intentional about how you show up.</p>
                    <p>The executives who command respect virtually are the ones who've mastered the medium. They understand that small details—lighting, background, camera angle—matter. They contribute strategically rather than constantly. And they use the unique aspects of virtual communication to amplify rather than diminish their leadership impact.</p>
