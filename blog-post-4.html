                    <p class="blog-post__excerpt">What actually happens on the other side of the table when you negotiate—and how to use that knowledge to your advantage.</p>
                </header>
                <div class="blog-post__content">
                    <p>Let me tell you what happens when you submit a salary counteroffer at a Fortune 500 company. I'm going to pull back the curtain on the negotiation process because understanding what hiring managers are actually thinking will transform your approach.</p>
                    <p>After negotiating hundreds of offers at Microsoft, IBM, and Kodak, I can tell you exactly which tactics work, which backfire, and why most candidates leave significant money on the table.</p>
                    <h2>The Hiring Manager Wants to Say Yes</h2>
                    <p>Here's what most candidates don't realize: by the time you receive an offer, your hiring manager has already fought to get approval for your position, spent weeks interviewing candidates, and convinced stakeholders that you're the right choice.</p>
                    <p>They want you to accept. They're invested in your success. This gives you more leverage than you think—but only if you use it correctly.</p>
                    <p>The key is making it easy for them to say yes to your request. That means being reasonable, being specific, and giving them a business justification they can take to compensation or their own manager.</p>
                    <h2>Never Accept the First Offer</h2>
                    <p>Fortune 500 companies almost never extend their best offer initially. There's always room to negotiate—typically 5-15% on base salary, and often more flexibility on sign-on bonus, stock options, or start date.</p>
                    <p>When I made offers at Microsoft, I expected candidates to negotiate. When someone accepted immediately, I sometimes wondered if they were too eager or didn't understand their market value.</p>
                    <p>But here's the critical part: how you negotiate matters as much as what you ask for.</p>
                    <h2>The Right Way to Counter</h2>
                    <p>Poor approach: "I was hoping for more money."</p>
                    <p>Effective approach: "I'm excited about this opportunity and ready to accept. Based on my research and the value I'll bring to the team, I was expecting the base salary to be in the $[X] range. Is there flexibility here?"</p>
                    <p>Notice the difference? The second approach expresses enthusiasm, provides a specific number, references market data, and frames it as a question rather than a demand.</p>
                    <p>As a hiring manager, the first response gives me nothing to work with. The second gives me ammunition to advocate for you with compensation.</p>
                    <h2>What You Can Actually Negotiate</h2>
                    <p>Many candidates focus exclusively on base salary and miss opportunities to negotiate other components that may have more flexibility:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sign-on bonus:</strong> Often easier to approve than permanent base salary increases</li>
                        <li><strong>Stock options:</strong> Significant flexibility in many tech and growth companies</li>
                        <li><strong>Start date:</strong> Sometimes worth negotiating for planned time off or to finish a project</li>
                        <li><strong>Title:</strong> Can impact your trajectory and future earning potential</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance review timing:</strong> Early review can accelerate your first raise</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>The Counteroffer Conversation</h2>
                    <p>When your current employer counters to keep you, be extremely careful. In my experience, 70-80% of people who accept counteroffers are gone within 12 months anyway.</p>
                    <p>Why? Because the underlying reasons you wanted to leave haven't changed. You've also signaled you were looking, which can impact how you're viewed for future opportunities internally.</p>
                    <p>Use competing offers to negotiate with new employers, but think very carefully before using them to stay in a role you were already trying to exit.</p>
                    <h2>When to Walk Away</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes a company genuinely can't meet your requirements. That's okay. If they're unwilling to move on base salary, ask about other components. If there's truly no flexibility anywhere, you need to decide if the opportunity is worth accepting below your target.</p>
                    <p>But remember: if they want you, there's almost always some room to negotiate. The question is whether you're asking in a way that makes it easy for them to say yes.</p>
