                    <p class="blog-post__excerpt">The job search landscape has fundamentally shifted. Here's what you need to know to compete effectively.</p>
                </header>
                <div class="blog-post__content">
                    <p>If you're using the same job search strategies you used five years ago, you're already behind. The hiring landscape at Fortune 500 companies has changed dramatically, and many job seekers haven't adapted.</p>
                    <p>Based on what I'm seeing from companies and candidates, here's what's different in 2025—and how you need to adjust your approach.</p>
                    <h2>AI Screening Is Now Standard</h2>
                    <p>It's not just ATS systems parsing your resume anymore. Companies are using AI to screen video interviews, assess candidate responses, and even predict job fit based on your online presence.</p>
                    <p>What this means for you: your digital presence matters more than ever. One-way video interviews are becoming common for initial screening rounds. Practice answering questions on camera. Ensure your LinkedIn profile is complete and professional. Be mindful of your public social media presence.</p>
                    <p>The AI is looking for clear communication, confidence, and alignment with the role requirements. Rambling answers or poor video quality can eliminate you before a human ever reviews your application.</p>
                    <h2>Remote Work Has Expanded—And Complicated—Your Competition</h2>
                    <p>The good news: you can apply for roles anywhere. The challenging news: you're competing with candidates anywhere.</p>
                    <p>That Director role in Seattle? You're competing with qualified candidates from New York to Austin to Chicago. Companies have access to deeper talent pools, which raises the bar for what they expect.</p>
                    <p>Your response: you need to differentiate beyond just qualifications. Demonstrate specific value, show cultural fit, and make it clear why you're not just qualified, but the right choice among hundreds of qualified candidates.</p>
                    <h2>The Hidden Job Market Is Larger Than Ever</h2>
                    <p>More roles are being filled through referrals and internal movements before they're ever posted publicly. At large companies, up to 40% of positions are filled this way.</p>
                    <p>This makes networking more critical than applying to posted jobs. If you're spending 80% of your time applying online and 20% networking, flip that ratio. The majority of your effort should be building relationships that lead to referrals.</p>
                    <p>Reach out to people in your target companies. Ask for informational interviews. Build genuine relationships before you need them. The candidates getting hired are the ones having conversations, not just submitting applications.</p>
                    <h2>Skills Matter More Than Degrees</h2>
                    <p>Major companies including Google, Apple, and IBM have dropped degree requirements for many roles. They're focusing on demonstrable skills and experience instead.</p>
                    <p>What you can do matters more than where you went to school. Certifications, portfolio work, concrete examples of impact—these carry increasing weight compared to traditional credentials.</p>
                    <p>If you're competing against candidates with more impressive educational backgrounds, shift the conversation to what you've accomplished. Bring case studies, metrics, and specific examples that prove your capabilities.</p>
                    <h2>Interview Processes Are Longer and More Rigorous</h2>
                    <p>Expect 5-7 interview rounds for professional roles at major companies. This includes panel interviews, case studies, presentations, and multiple one-on-ones.</p>
                    <p>Companies are investing more heavily in hiring decisions because the cost of a bad hire has increased. Remote work makes cultural fit harder to assess, so they're adding more evaluation steps.</p>
                    <p>Prepare for a marathon, not a sprint. Each round requires research, preparation, and follow-up. The candidates who succeed treat each interview as an opportunity to deepen the relationship, not just answer questions.</p>
                    <h2>Salary Transparency Is Changing Negotiations</h2>
                    <p>More states require salary ranges in job postings. This transparency helps you understand market rates, but it also means companies face pressure to make equitable offers.</p>
                    <p>You still can and should negotiate, but do your research first. Understand where the posted range comes from and be prepared to justify why you should be at the higher end based on your specific experience and value.</p>
                    <p>Generic requests for more money won't work. Data-driven negotiation based on your unique qualifications will.</p>
                    <h2>Your Online Presence Is Your Application</h2>
                    <p>Hiring managers are Googling you before interviews. They're reviewing your LinkedIn activity, checking your Twitter/X presence, and looking for any public content you've created.</p>
                    <p>This isn't invasion of privacy—it's due diligence. They want to understand who you are beyond your resume.</p>
                    <p>Audit your online presence. Google yourself and see what appears. Make sure your LinkedIn is current and professional. If you're active on social media, ensure your public posts reflect professional judgment.</p>
                    <p>Better yet, create content that demonstrates your expertise. Write about your industry, share insights, engage in professional discussions. This positions you as a thought leader and gives hiring managers additional evidence of your capabilities.</p>
                    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                    <p>The job search in 2025 requires more strategic thinking, better preparation, and stronger relationship building than ever before. The spray-and-pray approach of mass applications doesn't work when you're competing with a global talent pool being screened by AI.</p>
                    <p>Focus on quality over quantity. Build genuine relationships. Demonstrate specific value. And adapt your approach based on what's actually working, not what worked in the past.</p>
