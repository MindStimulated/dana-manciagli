  Summary

  You have 6 markdown files creating a complete documentation ecosystem:

  1. README.md = Complete reference manual (everything)
  2. PROJECT-SUMMARY.md = Status dashboard (what's done, what's next)
  3. DESIGN-OVERVIEW.md = Visual design bible (how it looks and why)
  4. CONTENT-GUIDE.md = Editor's handbook (where to find and change content)
  5. DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md = Launch verification system (comprehensive testing)
  6. QUICK-START.md = Express setup (get live in 5 minutes)

  The site is production-ready and positioned as a sophisticated professional legacy site for a Fortune 500
  career expert transitioning toward retirement. The design is editorial (Forbes/HBR style), low-maintenance,
   and focuses on selective speaking/consulting opportunities rather than active course sales.

  What changes would you like to make to this web app?

> Now I want you to review the current live website and see what we've done in comparison to the .md files. 
Please review and compare what the files show and what was done. If you could also review the deployments for
 notes if that is helpful, please do so. After reviewing, please update any files that are needing updating. 
Then I will ask you to give me a website breakdown from page, section titles, content for easy review for 
editing for the client. 

⏺ I'll review the current live website files, compare them to the documentation, check deployment notes, and
  then update any files that need updating.

  🎯 What This Means

  Before Launch

  You now have clear checklists to ensure the site works perfectly for:
  - Mobile users (50-70% of web traffic today)
  - Users with disabilities (15-20% of population)
  - Users on slow connections
  - Users with older devices

  Testing Priority

  Based on the code review, the website already has good fundamentals:
  - ✅ Responsive design implemented
  - ✅ Mobile menu functional
  - ✅ Touch-friendly design
  - ✅ Good color contrast
  - ✅ Semantic HTML

  Main gaps to address:
  1. Add alt text to 3 images (5 minutes)
  2. Test on real mobile devices (30 minutes)
  3. Run Lighthouse audit (5 minutes)
  4. Test with keyboard navigation (15 minutes)

  Success Criteria

  - Mobile: Usable on all devices 320px+, loads <3 seconds on 4G
  - Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, Lighthouse score 95+

will be making edits based on client feedback and I want to know what instructions to give the new chat to 
guide it best. please provide me with a good initial prompt explaining what we are doing.

  - ✅ Prevents common mistakes

  Alternative: Start with Short Version

  If you prefer a quicker start:
  1. Use the shorter prompt above
  2. Let the new Claude read the documentation files
  3. Then proceed with client feedback
